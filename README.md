# WebAR-ThreeJS

Augmented Reality has always been my favorite topic. 

With the prominent improvement on both hardware and software recently, I have witnessed so many marvelous creations. 

Now I dare to challenge myself to build my own AR project.

# How To Run

Make sure you have a SSL server and Node, NPM installed on it. If not, you can generate self-signed cert.pem and key.pem

Clone this project and type `npm insatll` then `npm start`. Later, open `https://{YOUR ID}:3000` on your phone and see the result.

# Future Work

1. Translating/scaling my model when moving camera - for a better AR project, it is important to show how we interact with virtual model.
2. Handle abrupt displacement of models - I think it's because sensors data have noises.
3. Use a more stable data sources - Sensors data are not reliable and well-rounded if designing a more delicate AR project. I think I can use other data source like GPS to optimize this project.
